# Census-Income-Analysis
In this project we will perform statistical analysis on the Census Income data where extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted from the US census data and in order to add anonimity among many things a lot of data has been masked. Even then its still one of the most extenstive Census Income dataset avaialable as generally only tables statistics are available for Census data across multiple countries.

Main predictive goal for the dataset was to predict for the proportion of people having income greater than 50K USD, adjusting for the inflation this amount would be 102K USD as of date of the making this report. This is the individual income, not the household income, and following that 50K was indeed a representation of high income group on 1994.

During this project we will cover Explanatory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Tests, Linear Models such as Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models, Bayesian Hierarchical Model, and a simple Neurel Network. Goal is to first clean the dataset, perform the EDA, and then check some planned hypothesis. After that we will fit various models and check for both inference and predictive capabilities of them. We will also analyze the use of Bayesian Mixture Model using MCMC algorithms for the dataset and whether they add to the value.
